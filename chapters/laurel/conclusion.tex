\section{Conclusion}

We propose \tool, a tool that automatically generates assertions
to fix Dafny proofs.
On top of regular LLM techniques, \tool helps the LLM by localizing the assertion
with a \emph{placeholder} and gives qualitative examples
using our \emph{proof similarity} metric.
On our new \dataset dataset, \tool synthesizes successfully
56.6\% of all the assertions extracted from real-world code with improvements
on both the success rate and the number of attempts needed.
These numbers show that carefully crafted prompts make LLMs a suitable tool
to automate assertion generation.
