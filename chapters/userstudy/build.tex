\section{Results: Impact of Verification on Development} \label{sec:build}

First, we present our results on how formal verification affects the phase of \emph{building} software.
%
First, the \emph{specification} phase is significantly impacted, as the informal requirements
of classical software engineering are now augmented with formal artifacts that describe
what the code should do (\cref{sec:specification}).
%
Second, the use of verifiers significantly changes the \emph{implementation} phase because
now, in addition writing the code that runs, engineers must also write auxiliary assertions
and lemmas that are needed to help the verifier formally establish that the code meets its
specification (\cref{sec:implementation}).
%
Third, the notion of \emph{debugging} is also transformed as a significant effort goes into
understanding why the verifier fails to prove that the code meets its specification and to
then determine the appropriate hints to provide to the verifier to help it succeed (\cref{sec:debug}).
%
Finally, we find that verifiers that make extensive use of brittle SMT solver heuristics
to automate verification, add a new phase to the process of building software:
that of \emph{hardening} the code so that the proofs continue to hold even as the specific
solver heuristics might change across future versions (\cref{sec:harden}).
