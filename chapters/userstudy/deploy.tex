\section{Results: Impact of Verification on Assurance Methods}
\label{sec:assure}
\label{sec:deploy}

In this section, we describe how formal verification
affects the subsequent \emph{deployment} of software.
%
First, we show how verification influences \emph{testing}
by on the one hand, removing the need to exhaustively test
implementations, but instead shifting some of that effort
to testing formal specifications themselves (\cref{sec:test}).
%
Second, we demonstrate how verification impacts \emph{code review},
again by moving effort to reviewing specifications (not proofs),
and the transpiled code generated in various target languages
from the (verified) Dafny sources (\cref{sec:review}).
%
Third, we consider how the verified code is \emph{packaged}
as libraries that can then be used by clients in production,
and the constraints that such clients place on the verified
development process itself (\cref{sec:package}).
%
Finally, we consider how verification impacts the long term
\emph{maintenance} of software, by enabling formal analysis
to delimit the impact of changes, and thus, fearless
optimization (\cref{sec:maintain}).
