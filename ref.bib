In this work, we show that retrieval can be practically implemented using dense representations alone, where embeddings are learned from a small number of questions and passages by a simple dual-encoder framework. When evaluated on a wide range of open-domain QA datasets, our dense retriever outperforms a strong Lucene-BM25 system greatly by 9{\%}-19{\%} absolute in terms of top-20 passage retrieval accuracy, and helps our end-to-end QA system establish new state-of-the-art on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks.",

abstract = {We present a neural model for representing snippets of code as continuous distributed vectors (``code embeddings''). The main idea is to represent a code snippet as a single fixed-length code vector, which can be used to predict semantic properties of the snippet. To this end, code is first decomposed to a collection of paths in its abstract syntax tree. Then, the network learns the atomic representation of each path while simultaneously learning how to aggregate a set of them.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by using it to predict a method's name from the vector representation of its body. We evaluate our approach by training a model on a dataset of 12M methods. We show that code vectors trained on this dataset can predict method names from files that were unobserved during training. Furthermore, we show that our model learns useful method name vectors that capture semantic similarities, combinations, and analogies.  A comparison of our approach to previous techniques over the same dataset shows an improvement of more than 75\%, making it the first to successfully predict method names based on a large, cross-project corpus. Our trained model, visualizations and vector similarities are available as an interactive online demo at http://code2vec.org. The code, data and trained models are available at https://github.com/tech-srl/code2vec.},

  abstract  = {Peer code review is a practice widely adopted in software projects to improve the quality of code. In current code review practices, code changes are manually inspected by developers other than the author before these changes are integrated into a project or put into production. We conducted a study to obtain an empirical understanding of what makes a code change easier to review. To this end, we surveyed published academic literature and sources from gray literature (blogs and white papers), we interviewed ten professional developers, and we designed and deployed a reviewability evaluation tool that professional developers used to rate the reviewability of 98 changes. We find that reviewability is defined through several factors, such as the change description, size, and coherent commit history. We provide recommendations for practitioners and researchers.

  abstract  = {Little is known about the quality of formalizations in interactive theorem proving. In this work, we analyze the relationship between static analysis warnings (lints) and maintenance effort for 6470 Isabelle theories, create models to predict lints based on structural features, and compare the results to a small ground-truth dataset collected with the help of domain experts. We find that for the majority of lints, there is a significant but low-strength correlation between frequency of occurrence and churn in maintenance change-sets. In particular, for proofs using tactic methods (which can be brittle), the Spearman correlation is highest with a strength of 0.16, p<0.005. Furthermore, when classifying theories as lint-prone based on their formal entity graphs (which capture the dependencies between underlying logical entities), random forests outperform even deep learning models on our data, achieving 58 \% precision and 21 \% recall. Finally, in our ground-truth dataset of 35 good and 35 problematic theories, our pre-defined criterion that identifies theories with more than one lint every 100 lines achieves 95 \% precision and 51 \% recall. Remarkably, this is very close to the optimal criterion, which we observe at one lint every 109 lines. Moreover, the random forest model trained for lint-proneness even achieves perfect accuracy at 43 \% recall, providing additional evidence of its effectiveness.},

  abstract  = {Most interactive theorem provers provide support for some form of user-customizable proof automation. In a number of popular systems, such as Coq and Isabelle, this automation is achieved primarily through tactics, which are programmed in a separate language from that of the prover's base logic. While tactics are clearly useful in practice, they can be difficult to maintain and compose because, unlike lemmas, their behavior cannot be specified within the expressive type system of the prover itself.We propose a novel approach to proof automation in Coq that allows the user to specify the behavior of custom automated routines in terms of Coq's own type system. Our approach involves a sophisticated application of Coq's canonical structures, which generalize Haskell type classes and facilitate a flexible style of dependently-typed logic programming. Specifically, just as Haskell type classes are used to infer the canonical implementation of an overloaded term at a given type, canonical structures can be used to infer the canonical proof of an overloaded lemma for a given instantiation of its parameters. We present a series of design patterns for canonical structure programming that enable one to carefully and predictably coax Coq's type inference engine into triggering the execution of user-supplied algorithms during unification, and we illustrate these patterns through several realistic examples drawn from Hoare Type Theory. We assume no prior knowledge of Coq and describe the relevant aspects of Coq type inference from first principles.},

However, existing HCI methods can be impractical to apply to programming languages: languages have high iteration costs, programmers require significant learning time, and user performance has high variance. To address these problems, we adapted both formative and summative HCI methods to make them more suitable for programming language design. We integrated these methods into a new process, PLIERS, for designing programming languages in a user-centered way. We assessed PLIERS by using it to design two new programming languages. Glacier extends Java to enable programmers to express immutability properties effectively and easily. Obsidian is a language for blockchains that includes verification of critical safety properties. Empirical studies showed that the PLIERS process resulted in languages that could be used effectively by many programmers and revealed additional opportunities for language improvement.},

Embedded domain-specific languages (eDSLs) have the potential to serve these programmers while placing relatively light implementation burdens on language designers. However, barriers to eDSL use reduce their practical value and adoption. In this paper, we aim to deepen our understanding of how programmers use eDSLs and identify user needs to inform future eDSL designs. We performed a contextual inquiry (9 participants) with domain experts using Mimi, an eDSL for climate change economics modeling. A thematic analysis identified five key themes, including: the interaction between the eDSL and the host language has significant and sometimes unexpected impacts on eDSL user experience, and users preferentially engage with domain-specific communities and code templates rather than host language resources. The needs uncovered in our study offer design considerations for future eDSLs and suggest directions for future DSL usability research.},

  abstract  = {Even bad code can function. But if code isnt clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesnt have to be that way.Noted software expert Robert C. Martin, presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Martin, who has helped bring agile principles from a practitioners point of view to tens of thousands of programmers, has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code on the fly into a book that will instill within you the values of software craftsman, and make you a better programmerbut only if you work at it.What kind of work will you be doing? Youll be reading codelots of code. And you will be challenged to think about whats right about that code, and whats wrong with it. More importantly you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up codeof transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and smells gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.Readers will come away from this book understandingHow to tell the difference between good and bad codeHow to write good code and how to transform bad code into good codeHow to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classesHow to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logicHow to unit test and practice test-driven developmentWhat smells and heuristics can help you identify bad codeThis book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.}

  abstract = {This book addresses the topic of software design: how to decompose complex software systems into modules (such as classes and methods) that can be implemented relatively independently. The book first introduces the fundamental problem in software design, which is managing complexity. It then discusses philosophical issues about how to approach the software design process, and it presents a collection of design principles to apply during software design. The book also introduces a set of red flags that identify design problems. You can apply the ideas in this book to minimize the complexity of large software systems, so that you can write software more quickly and cheaply.}

  abstract  = {Verification toolchains are widely used to prove the correctness of critical software systems. To build confidence in their results, it is important to develop testing frameworks that help detect bugs in these toolchains. Inspired by the success of fuzzing in finding bugs in compilers and SMT solvers, we have built the first fuzzing and differential testing framework for Dafny, a high-level programming language with a Floyd-Hoare-style program verifier and compilers to C#, Java, Go, and Javascript. This paper presents our experience building and using XDsmith, a testing framework that targets the entire Dafny toolchain, from verification to compilation. XDsmith randomly generates annotated programs in a subset of Dafny that is free of loops and heap-mutating operations. The generated programs include preconditions, postconditions, and assertions, and they have a known verification outcome. These programs are used to test the soundness and precision of the Dafny verifier, and to perform differential testing on the four Dafny compilers. Using XDsmith, we uncovered 31 bugs across the Dafny verifier and compilers, each of which has been confirmed by the Dafny developers. Moreover, 8 of these bugs have been fixed in the mainline release of Dafny.},
